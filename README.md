# machine learning model + deploy
this repo is for making machine learning model to best fit on the data for the task
using packages to explore the data , cleaning and visualizing it 
the data was ready to be fed to the model
with using cross validation and several models using scikit learn
i get the best model of all to deploy using flask framework
